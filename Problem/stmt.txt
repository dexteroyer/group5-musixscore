Musixscore.com is an online service providing sheet music to customers. 
On the “browse music” Web page, customers select a genre of music from a dropdown list.
The web page fetches a list of performers, musicians, or groups that match a genre, 
which is formatted as a drop-down list. When a selection is made from the performers
drop-down list, the Web page fetches data to display a third drop-down list displaying
all of the CDs or other works of the performer. When a CD is selected, the Web page 
fetches data to obtain all the songs on the CD in a fourth drop-down list. The viewer 
may make multiple selections. When the Add to Shopping Cart image is clicked, the songs 
are added to the shopping cart. The viewer may change any of the  drop-down lists to 
select additional sheet music, and the process is repeated.
